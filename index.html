                <p class="article">In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing">computing</a>, multitasking is the <a href="">concurrent</a> execution
                    of multiple tasks (also known
                    as <a href="">processes</a>) over a certain period of time. New tasks can interrupt already started
                    ones before
                    they finish, instead of waiting for them to end. As a result, a computer executes segments of
                    multiple tasks in an interleaved manner, while the tasks share common processing resources such as
                    <a href="">central processing units </a> (CPUs) and <a href="">main memory</a>. Multitasking
                    automatically interrupts the running
                    program, saving its state (partial results, memory contents and computer register contents) and
                    loading the saved state of another program and transferring control to it. This <a href="">"context
                        switch"</a> may
                    be initiated at fixed time intervals (<a href="">pre-emptive multitasking</a>), or the running
                    program may be coded
                    to signal to the supervisory software when it can be interrupted (<a href="">cooperative
                        multitasking</a>).
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="article">Multitasking does not require <a href="">parallel execution</a> of multiple tasks at
                    exactly the same time; instead, it allows more than one task to advance over a given period of time.[1] Even on
                    <a href="">multiprocessor</a> computers, multitasking allows many more tasks to be run than there
                    are CPUs.

                <p class="article">Multitasking is a common feature of computer operating systems since at least the
                    1960s. It allows more efficient use of the computer hardware; when a program is waiting for some
                    external event such as a user input or an <a href="">input/output</a> transfer with a peripheral to
                    complete, the
                    central processor can still be used with another program. In a time-sharing system, multiple human
                    operators use the same processor as if it was dedicated to their use, while behind the scenes the
                    computer is serving many users by multitasking their individual programs. In <a
                        href="">multiprogramming</a>
                    systems, a task runs until it must wait for an external event or until the operating system's
                    <a href="">scheduler</a> forcibly swaps the running task out of the CPU. <a href="">Real-time</a>
                    systems such as those designed
                    to control industrial robots, require timely processing; a single processor might be shared between
                    calculations of machine movement, communications, and user interface

                    Often multitasking operating systems include measures to change the priority of individual tasks, so
                    that important jobs receive more processor time than those considered less significant. Depending on
                    the operating system, a task might be as large as an entire application program, or might be made up
                    of smaller <a href="">threads</a> that carry out portions of the overall program.

                <hr>
                <p class="article2">In the early days of computing, <a href="">CPU time</a> was expensive, and
                    peripherals were very
                    slow. When the computer ran a program that needed access to a peripheral, the central processing
                    unit (CPU) would have to stop executing program instructions while the peripheral processed the
                    data. This was usually very inefficient. Multiprogramming is a computing technique that enables
                    multiple programs to be concurrently loaded and executed into a computer's memory, allowing the CPU
                    to switch between them swiftly. This optimizes CPU utilization by keeping it engaged with the
                    execution of tasks, particularly useful when one program is waiting for I/O operations to complete.
                    <br><br>
                    The <a href="">Bull Gamma 60</a>, initially designed in 1957 and first released in 1960, was the
                    first computer
                    designed with multiprogramming in mind. Its architecture featured a central memory and a Program
                    Distributor feeding up to twenty-five autonomous processing units with code and data, and allowing
                    concurrent operation of multiple clusters.
                    <br><br>
                    Another such computer was the <a href="">LEO III</a>, first released in 1961. During batch
                    processing, several
                    different programs were loaded in the computer memory, and the first one began to run. When the
                    first program reached an instruction waiting for a peripheral, the context of this program was
                    stored away, and the second program in memory was given a chance to run. The process continued until
                    all programs finished running. <a href="">[3]</a>
                    <br><br>
                    The use of multiprogramming was enhanced by the arrival of <a href="">virtual memory</a> and <a
                        href="">virtual machine</a>
                    technology, which enabled individual programs to make use of memory and operating system resources
                    as if other concurrently running programs were, for all practical purposes, nonexistent.[citation
                    needed]
                    <br><br>
                    Multiprogramming gives no guarantee that a program will run in a timely manner. Indeed, the first
                    program may very well run for hours without needing access to a peripheral. As there were no users
                    waiting at an interactive terminal, this was no problem: users handed in a deck of punched cards to
                    an operator, and came back a few hours later for printed results. Multiprogramming greatly reduced
                    wait times when multiple batches were being processed. <a href="">[4][5]</a>

                <hr>
                <p class="article2">&nbsp &nbsp Main article: <a href="">Cooperative multitasking</a>
                    <br>
                    Early multitasking systems used applications that voluntarily ceded time to one another. This
                    approach, which was eventually supported by many computer operating systems, is known today as
                    cooperative multitasking. Although it is now rarely used in larger systems except for specific
                    applications such as CICS or the JES2 subsystem, cooperative multitasking was once the only
                    scheduling scheme employed by Microsoft Windows and classic Mac OS to enable multiple applications
                    to run simultaneously. Cooperative multitasking is still used today on RISC OS systems.[6]
                    <br><br>
                    As a cooperatively multitasked system relies on each process regularly giving up time to other
                    processes on the system, one poorly designed program can consume all of the CPU time for itself,
                    either by performing extensive calculations or by busy waiting; both would cause the whole system to
                    hang. In a server environment, this is a hazard that makes the entire environment unacceptably
                    fragile.

                        multitasking</a></p>
                <p class="article3">Preemptive multitasking allows the computer system to more reliably guarantee to
                    each process a regular "slice" of operating time. It also allows the system to deal rapidly with
                    important external events like incoming data, which might require the immediate attention of one or
                    another process. Operating systems were developed to take advantage of these hardware capabilities
                    and run multiple processes preemptively. Preemptive multitasking was implemented in the PDP-6
                    Monitor and Multics in 1964, in OS/360 MFT in 1967, and in Unix in 1969, and was available in some
                    operating systems for computers as small as DEC's PDP-8; it is a core feature of all Unix-like
                    operating systems, such as Linux, Solaris and BSD with its derivatives,[7] as well as modern
                    versions of Windows.</p>

                <p class="article2">At any specific time, processes can be grouped into two categories: those that are
                    waiting for input or output (called "I/O bound"), and those that are fully utilizing the CPU ("CPU
                    bound"). In primitive systems, the software would often "poll", or "busywait" while waiting for
                    requested input (such as disk, keyboard or network input). During this time, the system was not
                    performing useful work. With the advent of interrupts and preemptive multitasking, I/O bound
                    processes could be "blocked", or put on hold, pending the arrival of the necessary data, allowing
                    other processes to utilize the CPU. As the arrival of the requested data would generate an
                    interrupt, blocked processes could be guaranteed a timely return to execution.[citation needed]
                    <br><br>
                    The earliest preemptive multitasking OS available to home users was Sinclair QDOS on the Sinclair
                    QL, released in 1984, but it was not a big success. Commodore's Amiga, released the following year,
                    was the first commercially successful home computer to use the technology, and its multimedia
                    abilities make it a clear ancestor of contemporary multitasking personal computers. Microsoft made
                    preemptive multitasking a core feature of their flagship operating system in the early 1990s when
                    developing Windows NT 3.1 and then Windows 95. In 1988 Apple offered A/UX as a UNIX System V-based
                    alternative to the Classic Mac OS. In 2001 Apple switched to the NeXTSTEP-influenced Mac OS X.
                    <br><br>
                    A similar model is used in Windows 9x and the Windows NT family, where native 32-bit applications
                    are multitasked preemptively.[8] 64-bit editions of Windows, both for the x86-64 and Itanium
                    architectures, no longer support legacy 16-bit applications, and thus provide preemptive
                    multitasking for all supported applications.

                <p class="article2">Another reason for multitasking was in the design of real-time computing systems,
                    where there are a number of possibly unrelated external activities needed to be controlled by a
                    single processor system. In such systems a hierarchical interrupt system is coupled with process
                    prioritization to ensure that key activities were given a greater share of available process
                    time.[9]</p>

                <hr>
                <p class="article2">As multitasking greatly improved the throughput of computers, programmers started to
                    implement applications as sets of cooperating processes (e. g., one process gathering input data,
                    one process processing input data, one process writing out results on disk). This, however, required
                    some tools to allow processes to efficiently exchange data.[citation needed]
                    <br><br>
                    Threads were born from the idea that the most efficient way for cooperating processes to exchange
                    data would be to share their entire memory space. Thus, threads are effectively processes that run
                    in the same memory context and share other resources with their parent processes, such as open
                    files. Threads are described as lightweight processes because switching between threads does not
                    involve changing the memory context.[10][11][12]

                    While threads are scheduled preemptively, some operating systems provide a variant to threads, named
                    fibers, that are scheduled cooperatively. On operating systems that do not provide fibers, an
                    application may implement its own fibers using repeated calls to worker functions. Fibers are even
                    more lightweight than threads, and somewhat easier to program with, although they tend to lose some
                    or all of the benefits of threads on machines with multiple processors.[13]

                    Some systems directly support multithreading in hardware.

                <hr>
                <p class="article2">
                    Essential to any multitasking system is to safely and effectively share access to system resources.
                    Access to memory must be strictly managed to ensure that no process can inadvertently or
                    deliberately read or write to memory locations outside the process's address space. This is done for
                    the purpose of general system stability and data integrity, as well as data security.
                    <br><br>
                    In general, memory access management is a responsibility of the operating system kernel, in
                    combination with hardware mechanisms that provide supporting functionalities, such as a memory
                    management unit (MMU). If a process attempts to access a memory location outside its memory space,
                    the MMU denies the request and signals the kernel to take appropriate actions; this usually results
                    in forcibly terminating the offending process. Depending on the software and kernel design and the
                    specific error in question, the user may receive an access violation error message such as
                    "segmentation fault".
                    <br><br>
                    In a well designed and correctly implemented multitasking system, a given process can never directly
                    access memory that belongs to another process. An exception to this rule is in the case of shared
                    memory; for example, in the System V inter-process communication mechanism the kernel allocates
                    memory to be mutually shared by multiple processes. Such features are often used by database
                    management software such as PostgreSQL.
                    <br><br>
                    Inadequate memory protection mechanisms, either due to flaws in their design or poor
                    implementations, allow for security vulnerabilities that may be potentially exploited by malicious
                    software.

                <hr>
                <p class="article2">
                    Use of a swap file or swap partition is a way for the operating system to provide more memory than
                    is physically available by keeping portions of the primary memory in secondary storage. While
                    multitasking and memory swapping are two completely unrelated techniques, they are very often used
                    together, as swapping memory allows more tasks to be loaded at the same time. Typically, a
                    multitasking system allows another process to run when the running process hits a point where it has
                    to wait for some portion of memory to be reloaded from secondary storage.[14]

                <hr>
                <p class="article2">Processes that are entirely independent are not much trouble to program in a
                    multitasking environment. Most of the complexity in multitasking systems comes from the need to
                    share computer resources between tasks and to synchronize the operation of co-operating
                    tasks.[citation needed]
                    <br><br>
                    Various concurrent computing techniques are used to avoid potential problems caused by multiple
                    tasks attempting to access the same resource.[citation needed]
                    <br><br>
                    Bigger systems were sometimes built with a central processor(s) and some number of I/O processors, a
                    kind of asymmetric multiprocessing.[citation needed]
                    <br><br>
                    Over the years, multitasking systems have been refined. Modern operating systems generally include
                    detailed mechanisms for prioritizing processes, while symmetric multiprocessing has introduced new
                    complexities and capabilities
